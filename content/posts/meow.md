summary: A short poem on cats and ramen, by ChatGPT. A celebration of the feline and the noodle.

Cats purring softly by my side,  
Miso ramen warming me inside.  
Broth so savory, noodles so fine,  
Feline friends, all mine.  

Whiskers tickling my nose,  
Miso flavor warming my toes.  
Paws kneading gently on my lap,  
Ramen slurping, no time to nap.  

Cats and miso, a perfect pair,  
Comfort food and feline care.  
Satisfying both body and soul,  
Together they make me whole.
